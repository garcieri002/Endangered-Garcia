<h1>What is a Blue Whale?</h1>
<p>The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. It weighed as much as 200 tons.The blue whale has a heart the size of a Volkswagon Beetle.
They are the loudest animal on Earth and are even louder than a jet engine. Their calls can reach up to 188 decibels while a jet engine can reach only 140 decibels.
Their low frequency calls can be heard from hundreds of miles away and are most likely used to attract other blue whales.</p>
<p>Sadly,they are now endangered. There is a population of about 10,000 to 25,000 blue whales.</p>
<p>Their length can vary on each blue whale. Some could be 80 feet long and others could reach up to 100 feet long.</p>
<p>They mainly live in Southern Chile, The Gulf of California, and the Coral Triangle.</p>

<h1>How is such a large animal endangered?</h1>
<p>WIth it being the largest animal in the world you'd think it can't be endangered. But due to enviormental changes and othr things it has.
    Many blue whales have lost their habitats due to the changes in enviorment. </p>
<p>Blue whales are also endangered because of being struck by ships
and getting entangled in fishing gear.</p>
<p>Another reason is climate change and its impact on the krill, which is what blue whales eat the most.</p>

<h1>How are blue whales important?</h1>
<p>Blue whales are very important to the ecosystem. Whales are at the top of the food chain and have an important role in the overall
health of the marine enviorment.</p>
<p>Since blue whales are at the top of the food chain they eat fish and other invertebrates. When they die, their carcasses sink and
serve as food to a host of organisms.</p>
<p>Whales act like a pump that recirculates the fish and zooplankton that they've injested toward the surface. In the form of nitrogen rich
fecal matter. These nutrients are essential to the primary production of the marine ecosystem.</p>
